# rickandmorty

A simple fetch practice for APIs done at the beginning of the Full Stack Development Bootcamp with BBK and The Bridge.

It is just an application that I am developing throughout the course now only in spare time.

Right now it just randomly shows 9 characters from one of the 42 parts of this Rick and Morty API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest random too.

In the future I will turn it into a small wiki with all the interconnected information.

Stay tuned!
