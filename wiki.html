                You don't frighten us, English pig dogs. Go and boil your bottoms, you sons of a silly person. I
                blow my
                nose at you, so-called "Arthur King," you and all your silly English K-nig-hts. I'm Brian, and so's
                my
                wife!

                And finally, a wafer thin mint. Pero las llamas son peligrosas. Si usted ve una llama donde hay
                gente.
                nadando, usted gritar: ¡Cuidado! ¡Llamas! I told you to lay off the beans, you whore! Hegel is
                arguing
                that the reality is merely an a priori adjunct of non-naturalistic ethics, Kant via the categorical
                imperative is holding that ontologically it exists only in the imagination, and Marx claims it was
                offside.

                Ah, I see you have the machine that goes ping. This is my favorite. You see we lease it back from
                the
                company we sold it to and that way it comes under the monthly current budget and not the capital
                account.

                The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite held aloft Excalibur from the
                bosom
                of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. THAT is why I
                am
                your king.

                There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess all right, but no Messiah. Now go away! Come and see the
                violence inherent in the system. Help! Help! I'm being repressed! Listen, strange women lyin' in
                ponds
                distributin' swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a
                mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

                I object to all this sex on the television. I mean, I keep falling off! I cut down trees, I skip and
                jump, I like to press wildflowers. I put own womens' clothing, and hang around in bars. Why is it
                the
                world never remembered the name of Johann Gambolputty de von
                Ausfern-schplenden-schlitter-crasscrenbon-fried-digger-dangle-dongle-dungle-burstein-Von-knacker-thrasher-apple-banger-horowitz-ticolensic-grander-knotty-spelltinkle-grandlich-grumblemeyer-spelterwasser-kurstlich-himbleeisen-bahnwagen-gutenabend-bitte-ein-nürnburger-bratwurstle-gerspurten-mit-zwei-macheluber-hundsfut-gumberaber-shoenendanker-kalbsfleisch-mittler-aucher
                von Hautkopft of Ulm? I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough
                wiper! I
                fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! I'm
                afraid I have no choice but to sell you all for scientific experiments.

                At this time, a friend shall lose his friend's hammer and the young shall not know where lieth the
                things possessed by their fathers that their fathers put there only just the night before, about
                eight
                o'clock. This is boring. Let's go watch a stoning. Stwike him, Centuwion! Stwike him vewy wuffly!
                Manacles! Ooooh, my idea of heaven, is to be allowed to be put in manacles. Just for a few hours.
                They
                must think the sun shines out your ass, sonny. All right, but apart from the sanitation, medicine,
                education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh water system and public health, what
                have
                the Romans ever done for us?

                Oh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face? I sometimes hang awake at night, dreaming of
                being
                spat at in the face There's no Messiah in here. There's a mess all right, but no Messiah. Now go
                away!
                I'm not a roman mum, I'm a kike, a yid, a heebie, a hook-nose, I'm kosher mum, I'm a Red Sea
                pedestrian,
                and proud of it! Hey! Your nose is going to be three foot wide across your face by the time I'm
                finished
                with you! I will not have my fwends widiculed by the common soldiewy. Anybody else feel like a
                little...
                giggle... when I mention my fwiend... Biggus... Dickus?

                Well, I think I should point out first, Brian, in all fairness, we are not, in fact, the rescue
                committee. However, I have been asked to read the following prepare statement on behalf of the
                movement.
                "We the People's Front of Judea, brackets, officials, end brackets, do hereby convey our sincere
                fraternal and sisterly greetings to you, Brian, on this, the occasion of your martyrdom." I'm not a
                roman mum, I'm a kike, a yid, a heebie, a hook-nose, I'm kosher mum, I'm a Red Sea pedestrian, and
                proud
